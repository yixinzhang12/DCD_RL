# developmental-coordination-disorder-reinforcement-learning
We use reinforcement learning to model learning deficiency in adolescents with developmental coordination disorder (DCD). 

Note:
There are two .venv environments in this repository (my bad for naming them the same thing). The .venv in root folder (DCD_RL) is for general data analysis and parameter calculation. The .venv in CPSC533V_2024W1 is for RL model building.
